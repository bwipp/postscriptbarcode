# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All development is done against the current head of the master branch,
with a single train of releases being tagged from the master branch
regularly and often. Bugfixes are not backported to old versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For BWIPP, most security bugs are "just bugs", so report them openly via the
issue tracker.

If you determine that the issue is so serious as to place users' systems at
grave risk then feel free to contact the author directly. But it is unlikely
to result in coordinated disclosure: The ecosystem is too diverse with the
code finding itself in many esoteric places.
