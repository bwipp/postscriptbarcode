/*! \mainpage libpostscriptbarcode Documentation

The purpose of the C library and SWIG-based bindings for other languages is to
provide helper functions for manipulating the [Barcode Writer in Pure
PostScript](http://bwipp.terryburton.co.uk) resources based on metadata
contained within the monolithic barcode.ps file.

It is hoped that these can provide a stable and robust interface to BWIPP that
avoids the need for frontends to parse and process the PostScript resource file
directly or embed lots of static data about the resources in their code.
