Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript

Description:

Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript facilitates the printing of all
major barcode symbologies entirely within PostScript.

Since this resource is written in PostScript and interpretted
within the virtual machine of a printer it is compatible with
virtually any operating system and hardware platform.

It makes including any barcode within a PostScript document as
simple as inserting the following directive:

100 150 moveto (1-86074-271) (includetext height=0.9) isbn


Files:

barcode.ps

This file is the main PostScript resource that should be included
within the prologue of any PostScript document in which you would
like to produce barcodes. Alternatively this resource can be
loaded into the virtual machine of a PostScript printer until 
hardware reset, removing the need to include the resource in each
document. To do this uncomment the relevant line near top of the 
file and send it to the printer.

sample.ps

This file contains an example invocation of each of the encoders
to produce a page containing an instance of each barcode 
symbology.

barcode_with_sample.ps

The file contains both the resource and sample produced by
concatinating barcode.ps and sample.ps. It is suitable for 
viewing in a PostScript viewer such as gv or GSview, or sending 
directly to the printer with a command like:

lpr barcode_with_sample.ps (Unix)
copy /B barcode_with_sample.ps LPT1: (Windows)
