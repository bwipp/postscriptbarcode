# This script provides a simple continuous deployment
# solution that allows Travis CI to publish a new GitHub 
# release and upload assets to it whenever a tag is pushed.
#
# It is created as a temporary solution whilst we wait for
# Travis DPL to support GitHub:
#
# https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl
#
# Place this script somewhere like .travis/github-release.sh
# then add something like this to your .travis.yml:
#
# after_success: .travis/github-release.sh "$TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG" "`head -1 src/VERSION`" build/release/*
#
# The first argument is your repository in the format
# "username/repository", which Travis provides in the
# TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG environment variable.
#
# The second argument is the release version which as a
# sanity check should match the tag that you are releasing.
# You could pass "`git describe`" to omit this check.
#
# The remaining arguments are a list of asset files that you
# want to publish along with the release.
#
# The script requires that you create a GitHub OAuth access
# token to facilitate the upload:
#
# https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use
#
# You must pass this securely in the GITHUBTOKEN environment
# variable:
#
# http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/#Secure-environment-variables
#
# For testing purposes you can create a local convenience
# file in the script directory called GITHUBTOKEN that sets
# the GITHUBTOKEN environment variable. If you do so you MUST
# ensure that this doesn't get pushed to your repository,
# perhaps by adding it to a .gitignore file.
#
# Should you get stuck then look at a working example. This
# code is being used by Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript
# for automated deployment:
#
# https://github.com/terryburton/postscriptbarcode
