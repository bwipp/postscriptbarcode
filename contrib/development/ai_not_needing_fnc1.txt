References for table of AIs not requiring termination with an FNC1 character:

  * ISO/IEC 24723: GS1 Composite "Table B.1 - Application identifier with predefined length"
  * ISO/IEC 24724: GS1 DataBar "Table D1 âˆ’ Application identifiers with predefined length"
  * GS1 DataMatrix Introduction and technical overview - "2.2.3 Pre-defined length vs. fixed length element strings"
  * GS1 General Specifications: Figure 7.8.4-2. Element strings with predefined length using GS1 Application Identifiers"

These include comments to the effect that the list is immutable. However, it
should be noted that GS1 still replaced fixed-length AI (23) with
variable-length AI (235)!
